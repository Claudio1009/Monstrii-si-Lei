[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/Claudio1009/Monstrii-si-Lei)

"Monstrii si Lei" (Romanian for "Monsters and Lei," a pun on the "Lei" currency) is a C++ console application designed to simulate and calculate the production costs for a film project. It uses the cast and crew list from the "Wednesday" series as its base data to estimate expenses across various categories like accommodation, transport, catering, and special effects makeup. The application can calculate daily costs and aggregate them over 30, 45, 60, and 100-day periods.

## Features

*   **Cast Management**: Reads the cast and crew list from `wednesdayCast.csv` and can dynamically add 132 extras ("figuranți") to the list.
*   **Makeup Cost Calculation**: Randomly assigns a monster type (Vampire, Werewolf, Siren, Seer, Human) to each person and calculates the total daily makeup cost based on predefined rates per type.
*   **Transportation Cost**: Calculates the total cost for renting buses required to transport the entire cast and crew round-trip from the airport.
*   **Castle Rental**: Determines the total rental cost for a castle based on a daily rate, applying a progressive discount for longer rental periods.
*   **Accommodation Cost**: Calculates the daily hotel costs by optimally assigning the main cast and extras to different room types (2-person and 3-person rooms).
*   **Catering & Diet Management**:
    *   Assigns a random diet (omnivorous, vegetarian, or flexitarian) to each person and saves the list to `diete.csv`.
    *   Calculates the total daily food cost based on the assigned diets.
    *   Generates example menus for each diet type and saves them to `meniuri.csv`.
*   **Beverage Cost**: Estimates the daily cost of beverages (water, coffee, juice) for the entire production team.
*   **Total Cost Aggregation**: Bundles all calculated costs for a specified duration (30, 45, 60, or 100 days), converts the final sum from Romanian Lei (RON) to US Dollars (USD), and appends a detailed cost breakdown to `costuri.csv`.

## Project Structure

*   `castfestival.cpp`: The main C++ source file containing all the application logic and console menu.
*   `wednesdayCast.csv`: The primary input file, containing the list of cast and crew members.
*   `costuri.csv`: An output CSV file that stores the final aggregated cost breakdowns in USD for different time periods.
*   `diete.csv`: An output file generated by the application, detailing the assigned dietary plan for each person.
*   `meniuri.csv`: An output file with sample menus for the different dietary plans.
*   `dictionar.py`: An auxiliary Python script to translate a CSV file (not integrated into the main C++ application).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You will need a C++ compiler, such as G++.

### Compilation
Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command to compile the program:
```bash
g++ castfestival.cpp -o production_calculator
```

### Execution
Run the compiled program from your terminal:
```bash
./production_calculator
```
The application requires the `wednesdayCast.csv` file to be present in the same directory to function correctly.

### Usage
Once running, the application will display a menu of options. Enter the number corresponding to the desired action and press Enter.

1.  **Lista Actorilor**: Displays the full cast list and allows adding randomly generated extras.
2.  **Monstri numar**: Calculates and displays the daily cost for character makeup.
3.  **Autobuze si pret**: Calculates and displays the cost for bus transportation.
4.  **CastelChirie-CalculatorReducere**: Calculates the total castle rental cost for a specified number of days.
5.  **CamereHotel**: Calculates and displays the daily accommodation costs.
6.  **Cost Bauturi intr-o zi**: Calculates and displays the daily beverage costs.
7.  **Meniuri Cheltuiala intr-o zi**: Calculates and displays the daily catering costs and generates menu/diet files.
8.  **Calculator pe perioade de timp**: Calculates the total project cost for 30, 45, 60, or 100 days, converts it to USD, and saves the results to `costuri.csv`.
9.  **EXIT**: Closes the application.
